My dissertation studies different aspects of this challenge from a behavioural and sustainable operations perspective.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=4451618">The first project</a> studies how product variety and heterogeneity in preferences affect customer choices. Using a large, event-based clickstream dataset provided by one of Europe’s largest fast fashion retailers, the study characterizes and quantifies the effects of assortment variety on customer choice. The study proposes a novel definition and representation of assortment variety as a bipartite graph, which allows to define variety along three dimensions. Results show the dataset has three main segments, with contrasting utility for economic variables, variety, and propensity to convert to a purchase. The estimation results also show a combination of linear and nonlinear relationship between variety and customer utility. The findings highlight the inherent tensions of offering and efficiently managing large product variety to please different customer types.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=4866873">The second project</a> studies how fast fashion retailers can lower the environmental impact of their assortments by balancing profit maximization and impact minimization. This project adopts a system-focused approach by incorporating the consumers’, retailers’, and policymakers’ perspectives to study behavioural and environmental impacts of current fashion consumption and production practices, and evaluate how policy changes might affect the dynamics between the three parties involved. We propose an integrated framework that combines an incentive-aligned choice-based conjoint (IA-CBC) experiment, a Hierarchical Bayes Multinomial Logit (HB-MNL) model, and joint product-line and pricing optimization model to measure preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for three environmental attributes—Recycled Content, Durability, and Circularity Design—and the trade-off between profits and environmental constraints (regulations). By progressively tightening the constraints on environmental attributes, we reveal the profit-environmental impact trade-off frontier. Our experimental design also includes a between-subjects manipulation to study the impact of priming consumers as a reconciling mechanism between consumers, retailers and policymakers. We find that environmental attributes are important, but that Price remains the main driver of choice. Our results also define a clear hierarchy of importance between environmental attributes and their levels, and highlight confusion towards Durability. We find that constraints on Recycled Content have the most impact on business performances, and that it is almost always optimal for the retailer to offer a Circularity Design level. Importantly, we find that retailers can efficiently manage trade-offs at low levels of environmental constraints that bear no impact on business performances (when compared to the status quo). Finally, we find that priming consumer significantly shifts attribute importance, increases WTP, and consequently considerably eases the profit-environmental impact trade-off. For managers, our methodology and results provide a <a href="https://osf.io/9a2me/?view_only=b2b47a55d6a04a2fab0bc36ac67335b8">strategic decision support tool</a> to optimally adapt assortments to consumer demand and regulations. For policymakers, we provide valuable empirical evidence to develop fair regulations.</p> <p>The last chapter studies overproduction in fast fashion and examines whether the inefficacy in the industry comes from the inability in the models to address uncertainty in consumer demand, or from the lack of deterrents to overproduction (e.g., lenient regulations). The study uses a robust product-line and inventory model in which uncertainty in consumer preferences is de-aggregated into two components: heterogeneity in taste, and uncertainty in measurement. The former is captured with by parametrizing the demand function as a mixture of Multinomial Logit (MNL) models, while the latter is captured through one of the product attributes (Style/Trend). The study uses a synthetic dataset of choice data for products defined using 4 attributes and price.</p> <p>The results from my work provide several managerial insights and readily-implementable tools, as well as strong policy implications that can help in solving the many environmental challenges the fast fashion industry is facing.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="PhD"/><category term="PhD"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An overview of my PhD work]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">PhD project 1</title><link href="https://jsmatte.github.io/blog/2022/phd-project1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="PhD project 1"/><published>2022-11-06T15:12:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-11-06T15:12:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jsmatte.github.io/blog/2022/phd-project1</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jsmatte.github.io/blog/2022/phd-project1/"><![CDATA[<p><em>This series of blog posts presents the different projects I am working on for my PhD dissertation.
