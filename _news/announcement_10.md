I have the honour of being invited to present one of my thesis project on lowering the environmental impact of fashion retail assortments at the <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/research/seminars-conferences/Pages/event.aspx?conf=coer-2024&view=home">Consortium for Operational Excellence in Retailing (COER)</a> at Harvard Business School. Looking forward to sharing this work with academic and industry attendees!
