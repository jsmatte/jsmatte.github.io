Still buzzing from this yearâ€™s COER conference at Harvard Business School! Had the privilege to present our (with Mehmet Gumus and Robert Rooderkerk) project on the lowering the environmental impact of fashion assortments, followed by a discussion of the topic with Doug Freeman (former COO of Patagonia) and the audience. 

Thanks to everyone present for participating in the polls (more on that soon!) and sharing their thoughts and experience with us, and of course, many thanks to Marshall Fisher, Ananth Raman, and Anna C. Sheen for inviting me and organizing this wonderful event!
