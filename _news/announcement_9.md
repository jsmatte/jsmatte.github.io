Feel honored to be mentioned in this year's summary of the <a href="https://www.ewg-retail-ops.eu/.cm4all/uproc.php/0/Dokumente/Report_6thEWGMeeting-Stockholm.pdf?cdp=a&_=18b13e36aa8">EWG's 2023 Retail Operations Meeting</a> in Stockholm (sandwiched between Toni Moreno's keynote and Santiago Gallino's talk)! Such an amazing event that allowed me to collect very positive and insightful feedback on my research, in addition to connecting with old and new friends. Looking forward to next year's edition in Vienna.
