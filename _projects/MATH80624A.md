See the <a href="https://github.com/jsmatte/MATH80624A">github repo</a> for the code/notebooks and solutions to the two assignments and our term project. All the work done in collaboration with Sena Oz.

Our term project was based on the paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0096300320306044">*Ma, G., Zheng, J., Wei, J., Wang, S., & Han, Y. (2021). Robust optimization strategies for seller based on uncertainty sets in context of sequential auction.*</a> We noted some shortcomings in the reformulations presented by the authors, and thus proposed reformulations of their reformulations. Additionally, we proposed an extension of the model presented by the authors, where we use a data-driven approach to defining the uncertainty set by using the variance of the coefficient estimates of a linear regression as the uncertainty set. Our proposed application was limited by the lack of real data. Instead, we had to generate synthetic data.
