I am a final-year PhD candidate in Operations Management at [Desautels Faculty of Management](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/), [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca).

My research interests are in sustainable operations and behavioural economics, focusing on fashion retail. 
<!-- I am interested in understanding how product variety affects consumer choices, and how fashion retailers can become more efficient at managing assortments and production quantities. I am also interested in studying the trade-offs that exist between the sunk cost of sustainable operations, increased consumer experience (in terms of willingness-to-pay), and increased quality of products put on the market, which would result in reduced consumption.
Consequently,  -->
<!-- I focus on **bridging theory and practice** by **developing data-driven modelling and optimization algorithms** to help fashion retailers move towards less impactful operations by combining consumer behaviour, assortment and inventory optimization models, and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) data. -->
By leveraging my former experience as a design engineer and project manager in NYC, my personal interests in planetary health and fashion, combined with rigorous PhD training in statistical modelling and optimization, I am uniquely positioned to **bridge theory and practice**. 
I develop **consumer-centric, data-driven models and prescriptive algorithms** to help fashion retailers **reduce the environmental impact** of their production.

A main theme of my dissertation work is addressing the **overproduction** and consequential environmental issues the fashion industry created. In addition to putting immense pressure on the supply chain, **overproduction practices are creating a huge waste problem**.
My goal is therefore to **promote a reduction of production volumes** through a deeper understanding of consumer behaviour and to more efficient management practices.
Through my work, I am **contributing to GOAL 12** of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

<!-- For the next academic year, I will be visiting Rotterdam School of Management--Erasmus University where I will collaborate with Prof. Robert Rooderkerk! -->
