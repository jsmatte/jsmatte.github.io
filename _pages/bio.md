### my story
In a previous life, I was trained and worked as a structural engineer, specialized in structural dynamics and earthquake engineering. <!--My previous research was concerned with geometrically (and thus structurally) asymmetric buildings and how they behave under seismic loading.-->For five years, I lived in New York City and worked at [LERA](https://www.lera.com) on the design and construction of tall buildings, museums, government buildings, and more. I also had the privilege to work on the World Trade Center.

While living in NYC, I became involved in the sustainable and ethical fashion movement through volunteering with [ProjectJUST](http://www.projectjust.com) and [Fashion Revolution USA](https://www.fashionrevolution.org/north-america/usa/). I immensely benefited from my interactions with everyone I met during that time, which lead me to rethink my career. I was no longer convinced about structural engineering, and found sustainable and ethical fashion to be, in Millenials terms, *a more meaningful direction to follow to have any kind of positive impact and change in the world we live in*. After a bit of soul searching, I found Operations Management to be at the crossroads of my background in engineering, and what I wanted to do in the future.


### I'm so much more than just my research!
Trying to change the world is great, but that's not all there is to life...
<!-- 
and pushing the boundaries of science 
It is all too easy to get absorbed in your work, but it usually never results in anything good. I have been a victim of it in NYC, and again during my PhD (thanks to COVID lockdown, it was too easy to spend "just another hour" working). -->

If I'm not behind a computer, there's a good chance I am cycling or skiing. I have spent more time on bikes and skis than I like to admit. I find the sensation of freedom it provides exhilarating. I used to compete in both, and aspired to become a professional skier. Somehow, I ended up un academia.
You may also occasionally find me running, and I take every opportunity to go hiking when close to mountains (in the summer months, during the winter, mountains are for skiing, obviously).

<!-- Second to sports is cooking. To me, it is more than just a time to eat, they bring people together. I love to host, take the time to cook a good meal and everything around it: presentation, wine pairing (I like to pretend I know about wine), etc. -->
And if I'm not doing any sports, I'm probably gone on an adventure or exploring, either locally in the cities I live in and their surroundings, or globally visiting other countries and cultures. 
<!-- (*Dutch update:* biking to the beach in the North Sea, (biking to) buying Gouda in Gouda, and (biking to) seeing a real-sized replica of Noah's arch near Dordrecht!).  -->
I like to spend the time I have left with my best boi Bruno, or to read, cook, or learn something new. 

Finally, I am passionate about mentoring and teaching. Back in the days, I taught English and skiing. More recently, my efforts were directed at promoting careers in STEM.

<!-- Fun fact: although I am Canadian, I have never been to a hockey game (I also don't really follow...) -->
