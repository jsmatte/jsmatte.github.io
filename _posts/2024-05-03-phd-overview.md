## Abstract
There is an increasing call for the fast fashion industry to lower its environmental impact. My dissertation studies different aspects of this challenge from a behavioural and sustainable operations perspective.

<a href="https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=4451618">The first project</a> studies how product variety and heterogeneity in preferences affect customer choices. Using a large, event-based clickstream dataset provided by one of Europeâ€™s largest fast fashion retailers, the study characterizes and quantifies the effects of assortment variety on customer choice. The study proposes a novel definition and representation of assortment variety as a bipartite graph, which allows to define variety along three dimensions. Results show the dataset has three main segments, with contrasting utility for economic variables, variety, and propensity to convert to a purchase. The estimation results also show a combination of linear and nonlinear relationship between variety and customer utility. The findings highlight the inherent tensions of offering and efficiently managing large product variety to please different customer types. 

<a href="https://osf.io/2u7sf">The second project</a> (preprint coming soon!) studies how fast fashion retailers can lower the environmental impact of their assortments by balancing profit maximization and impact minimization. 
<!-- There seems to be confusion and misunderstanding between retailers, consumers, and policymakers as to how the different dimensions of environmental impact in fashion are understood and valued. In addition, there are currently no regulation in place to curb the industry's highly impactful production.  -->
This project adopts a system-focused approach by incorporating the consumers', retailers', and policymakers' perspectives to study behavioural and environmental impacts of current fashion consumption and production practices, and evaluate how policy changes might affect the dynamics between the three parties involved.
<!-- The experimental and data-driven approach focuses on three main aspects: (a) understanding preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for environmental attributes, (b) characterizing and quantifying the impact of environmental constraints on business performances, and (c) assessing the effects of consumer education on preferences, WTP, and business performances. -->
We measure consumer preferences for three environtmental attributes---Recycled Content, Durability, and Circularity Design---through an incentive-aligned choice-based conjoint (IA-CBC) experiment, in combination with a between-subjects education manipulation.
We use a Hierarchical Bayes Multinomial Logit (HB-MNL) model to estimate individual-level consumer preferences and WTP for environmental attributes, and leverage it to assess the effect of consumer education on both preferences and WTP. 
Finally, we use these preference and WTP estimates in a product-line and pricing optimization subject to constraints on environmental attributes. By progressively tightening the constraints on environmental attributes, mimicking self- or regulatory-imposed levels, we reveal the profit-environmental impact trade-off frontier. 
We find that environmental attributes are important, but that Price remains the main driver of choice. Our results also define a clear hierarchy of importance between environmental attributes and their levels, and highlight confusion in understanding towards certain attributes.
We also find that retailers can efficiently manage trade-offs at low levels of environmental constraints that bear no impacts on business performances, and that it is always optimal for the retailer to offer a Circularity Design for all products in the assortment, irrespective of the environmental constraint level. 
Finally, we find that consumer education not only eases the profit-environmental impact trade-off, but also leads to a significant shift in attribute importance from Bill of Materials and Price towards the environmental attributes.
For managers, our methodology and results provide a <a href="https://osf.io/9a2me/?view_only=b2b47a55d6a04a2fab0bc36ac67335b8">strategic decision support tool</a> to optimally adapt assortments to consumer demand and regulations. For policymakers, we provide valuable empirical evidence to help in developing regulations. 

The last chapter studies overproduction in fast fashion and examines whether the inefficacy in the industry comes from the inability in the models to address uncertainty in consumer demand, or from the lack of deterrents to overproduction (e.g., lenient regulations). The study uses a robust product-line and inventory model in which uncertainty in consumer preferences is de-aggregated into two components: heterogeneity in taste, and uncertainty in measurement. The former is captured with by parametrizing the demand function as a mixture of Multinomial Logit (MNL) models, while the latter is captured through one of the product attributes (Style/Trend). The study uses a synthetic dataset of choice data for products defined using 4 attributes and price. 

The results from my work provide several managerial insights and readily-implementable tools, as well as strong policy implications that can help in solving the many environmental challenges the fast fashion industry is facing.
